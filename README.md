# Tiny Task Tools

# Idea
Create a tool/tools thats improves tiny task for specfic things, the main things that I want to include are:
- Discord webhook that will send an embed/update a embed showing information such as times ran and  other information
- allow the play/stop to be dynamic based on pixel on the screen
- maybe other stuff idk what yet


## How to use it

- Create .env file and add WEBHOOK = [webhook here]
